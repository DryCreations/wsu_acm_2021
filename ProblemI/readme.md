# Problem I - Football Scores

In monsterball, teams generally score ghostups (worth 7 points), or flap goals
(worth 3 points). Any number or combinations of ghostups and flap goals may
be scored in one game. Your task is to determine how many ways (permutations,
not combinations) a team could have scored a particular score.
