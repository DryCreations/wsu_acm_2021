# Problem J - Jigsaw Puzzle

Hello programmer, I want to play a game. The rules are simple, I will show
you a jigsaw puzzle and you will tell me how many pieces you have. The puzzle
will be transferred to you in the form of a two dimensional grid of characters,
either a.character to represent part of a piece or a#character representing a
boundary between the pieces.

A piece consists of a set of.characters that are adjacent horizontally or vertically
but not diagonally. For example the puzzle below has five pieces, one in each
corner and then another one in the middle.
